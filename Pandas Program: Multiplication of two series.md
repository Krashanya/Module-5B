## 🎯 Aim

Write a Python Pandas program first to carry out the Multiplication mathematics operations for the following two series d1 and d2. 
---

## 🧠 Algorithm

1. **Import Libraries**: Import the required libraries – `pandas`
2. Get input form the user and convert it into series using the pd.Series function.
3. Use the multiplication operator to find the multiplcation of the two series.
4. DIsplay the result.
